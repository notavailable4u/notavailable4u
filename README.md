- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @notavailable4u
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking classes to become a Full Stack Web Developer
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I became "notavailabe4u" after spending 15 minutes trying to create a GitHub username that WAS available. That's what I get for showing up late for the party.
