- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @notavailable4u (Patrick T.N. Gannon)
- ðŸŒ± I recently completed the Full Stack Web Development Program at CareerFoundry and I am currently looking for an entry level developer position. To learn more about me, and see some of my work samples, view my portfolio site: https://patrickwebdev.com/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I became "notavailabe4u" after spending 15 minutes trying to create a GitHub username that WAS available. That's what I get for showing up late for the party I guess. :wink:

<!---
notavailable4u/notavailable4u is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
