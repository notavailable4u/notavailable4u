- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @notavailable4u
- ðŸŒ± I recently completed the Full Stack Web Development Program at CareerFoundry and I am currently looking for an entry level developer position.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I became "notavailabe4u" after spending 15 minutes trying to create a GitHub username that WAS available. That's what I get for showing up late for the party I guess. :wink:
